# Big-Chile
Big Chile is a food truck that is located in the heart of Richmond, VA. Within the last year it has become quite popular in the area and famous for their authentic Tex-Mex food. While a group of friends and I were introducing the food truck to another one of our friends, he asked if they had a website where he could look up their menu ahead of time. It caught me by surprise that they did not have a website so I took it upon myself to develop a sample fun and easy to navigate site from scratch as one of my personal projects. I designed it with a responsive, modern look in mind.
